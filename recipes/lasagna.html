    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>To make the meat sauce, heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a frying pan and cook 750g lean beef mince in two batches for about 10 mins until browned all over.</li>
        <li>Finely chop 4 slices of prosciutto from a 90g pack, then stir through the meat mixture.</li>
        <li>Pour over 800g passata or half our basic tomato sauce recipe and 200ml hot beef stock. Add a little grated nutmeg, then season.</li>
        <li>Bring up to the boil, then simmer for 30 mins until the sauce looks rich.</li>
        <li>Heat oven to 180C/fan/160C/gas 4 and lightly oil an ovenproof dish (about 30 x 20cm).</li>
        <li>Spoon one third of the meat sauce into the dish, then cover with some fresh lasagne sheets from a 300g pack. Drizzle over roughly 130g ready-made or homemade white sauce.</li>
        <li>REpeat until you have 3 layesr of pasta. Cover with the remaining white sauce, making sure you can't see any pasta poke through.</li>
        <li>Scatter 125g torn mozzarella over the top.</li>
        <li>Arrange the rest of the prosciutto on top. Bake for 45 mins until the top is bubbling and browned.</li>
